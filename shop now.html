        visit the SEKU website and suggest how the advantages of styles sheets can be used:
        1.Multiple styles can be used in the seku website by applying modular approach.this can be done by breaking down
        the
        the seku style sheet into modular components, focussing on specific sections. This makes it easier to manage and
        update styles without affecting the entiresite.<br>
        2.Consistecy can be used in the seku website by applying spacing layout principles and by using uniform margins,
        padding and grid systems to maintain a structured and balanced appearance across pages.<br>
        3.Restyling can be used in the SEKU website by impementing responsive design to make the website more
        responsive.
        Adjisting styles based on different screen sizes using media queries, ensuring a seamless experience accross the
        devices.<br>
        4.Optimization can be used in SEKU website by implementing css frame work by using light weight css files or
        custom
        built styles instead of large files, comprehensive framework. This allows the including of necessesary styles
        for
        the specific prohect hence minimizing bloat.<br>
        5.Document maintenance can be used in the seku website by implementing version control. Using version systems to
        track changes in the style sheet. This will thus help identify who made modifications and allows for easy roll
        backs
        in case of errors.<br>
        6.styles and structured can be used in the SEKU website by implimenting transitions and animations so us to
        enhance
        the user expirience. Applying subtitle effects to elements help smoother transitions and engaging
        interaction.<br>
